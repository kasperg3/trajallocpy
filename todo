# To be done
* Convert lat/lon into utm and back when returning the solution
* random agent placement within the area


Experiments:
    compare:
        CBBA with point tasks
        CBBA with line tasks
        Clustered line tasks using a snake pattern
    metrics:
        convergence time
        Total path length
        Agent average distance
