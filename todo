Support plotting of:
    Search area 
    restricted area
    agents moving
    sweeps/tasks
    
Improvements:
    Return a set of edges for each agent
    support position initialization of agents
    Implement very simple point based version using only the midpoint of the tasks
    Convert from point task to line task
        Calculate the cost of adding a line task between two other line tasks
        Calculate a distance matrix of task graph using duplicated tasks to represent 
    Graph based shortest distance

    Create a Ros2 node and import this repo


TODO: 
    task direction/start+end:
        When the bundle is empty add the task closest to the agent, and swap the start/end if needed, store this in the path+bundle
    Add debugging


Experiments:
    compare:
        CBBA with point tasks
        CBBA with line tasks
        Clustered line tasks using a snake pattern
